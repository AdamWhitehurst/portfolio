  Body: `Learning how to make computers work is like magic to me. My amazement with video games sparked a desire to make them. As I have matured, so have my interests. I am consumed by the pursuit of refining my coding practices for clarity and efficiency. Nothing satisfies me more than concocting creative solutions to difficult or strange programming problems. User-experience design, the future of Javascript and Python, as well as machine-learning excite me. My goal in life is to continue developing my programming skills and die with a mouse in my hand, if they aren’t deprecated by then.`,
